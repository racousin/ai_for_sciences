Maurits Arif Fathoni Lubis & Tang Zhe | Proposal Title: AI-Based Automated Vectorization of Historical Maps
Background and Problem Statement
Historical maps contain a large amount of valuable spatial information, such as settlement locations, transportation networks, land use boundaries, and administrative divisions. However, most of these maps are only available as scanned images or PDFs. To use the information in modern GIS workflows, the features must be manually digitized into vector formats (points, lines, and polygons), which is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.
Given the growing availability of historical map archives, there is a strong need for an automated or semi-automated approach that can extract geospatial features directly from map images while preserving the semantic meaning defined in the map legend.

Objectives
The main objective of this workshop project is to develop an AI-based workflow that can automatically extract vector data from historical maps. Specifically, the project aims to:
Detect map objects represented as points, lines, and polygons from raster map images or PDFs.
Classify these objects into meaningful categories based on the map legend (e.g., roads, rivers, buildings, boundaries).
Convert the detected and classified objects into GIS-ready vector formats (shapefiles).

Preliminary Methods
The proposed approach will combine machine learning and deep learning techniques in several stages:
Map Preprocessing
Convert scanned maps’ image or PDFs into high-quality raster images.
Georeferencing the maps’ image or PDFs so it has coordinates information

Object Detection and Segmentation
Use deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) to detect and segment map elements such as symbols, lines, and filled regions.
Instance or semantic segmentation models can be applied to separate overlapping features and distinguish between different geometry types (points, lines, polygons).

Legend-Based Classification
Extract legend symbols and text from the map using computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR).
Match detected map objects with legend symbols using feature similarity and supervised classification models.

Vectorization and Export
Convert segmented raster objects into vector geometries.
Save the outputs as shapefiles with attribute information derived from legend classification.

Expected Outcomes
The expected outcome of this workshop is a prototype AI-based model or workflow that can:
Automatically generate point, line, and polygon shapefiles from historical map images.
Assign meaningful categories to extracted features based on the map legend.
Significantly reduce the time and effort required for digitizing historical maps, while improving consistency and reproducibility.
This project will demonstrate how AI can bridge the gap between historical cartographic archives and modern geospatial analysis, enabling more efficient reuse of historical spatial data in research and planning.

TrinidadBorrell | Topological Data Analysis and Graph Variational Autoencoders for Brain Connectivity Classification from EEG Signals
Objective
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals encode rich information about brain connectivity and dynamics, yet traditional feature extraction methods often fail to capture higher-order topological structures that emerge from neural interactions. This project aims to combine Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Graph Variational Autoencoders (Graph-VAE) to develop a hybrid approach for classifying motor imagery brain states from EEG data. By representing functional brain connectivity as graphs and extracting persistent homology features that capture multi-scale topological properties, while simultaneously learning compressed latent representations through a Graph-VAE, we seek to create robust and interpretable neural state classifiers that leverage both the geometric structure of brain networks and the persistent topological features that distinguish different motor imagery tasks.
Data Sources
We will use the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, a well-established benchmark for motor imagery classification. This dataset contains EEG recordings from 9 subjects performing four-class motor imagery tasks: left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue movements. The EEG signals were recorded using 22 Ag/AgCl electrodes positioned according to the international 10-20 system. This dataset is ideal for our purposes because it provides sufficient sample size for training graph-based models, the 22-electrode montage enables meaningful functional connectivity graph construction covering motor cortex regions, the four-class paradigm offers a challenging multi-class classification scenario, and its status as a benchmark allows direct comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
Preliminary Methodology
The methodology consists of three stages: first, constructing functional connectivity graphs from EEG signals using correlation-based measures within sliding time windows, with electrodes as nodes and connectivity strengths as edge weights; second, applying persistent homology to these graphs using Rips or Vietoris-Rips filtrations to extract topological features summarized as persistence diagrams and Betti curves; third, we will train a Graph Variational Autoencoder on the connectivity graphs to learn compressed latent representations that encode the essential structural patterns of brain networks for each motor imagery class. The hybrid feature set, combining TDA-derived topological descriptors with Graph-VAE latent embeddings, will feed into a downstream classifier for motor imagery discrimination. 
Expected Outcomes
We expect to demonstrate that combining TDA-derived topological features with Graph-VAE latent representations yields superior classification performance compared to using either approach alone. The topological features should provide robustness to noise and individual variability in EEG recordings due to their invariance to continuous deformations, while the Graph-VAE component learns task-specific connectivity patterns in a compressed latent space. We anticipate achieving competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on this benchmark dataset. The resulting framework should provide interpretable outputs revealing which topological properties of brain networks (persistent connected components, cycles) and which latent dimensions distinguish different motor imagery tasks, potentially offering insights into the functional organization of motor cortex during imagined movements.

Wenrui GAO | AI- Based Framework for Automated Cell-Type Annotation in Hepatic scRNA-seq

Data.

Objective
To develop a computational framework to identify and characterize fibroblast heterogeneity
within single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. By leveraging machine learning, this

project aims to automate the annotation of portal mesenchymal cells and uncover novel, high-
fidelity biomarkers for specific cellular clusters associated with healthy and fibrotic mouse

liver states.
Data source
This study utilizes a robust dataset of portal mesenchymal cells derived from 13 mouse models,
capturing a spectrum of physiological states from healthy controls to induced fibrosis. To
enhance the model's generalizability, these primary data will be integrated with relevant
publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
Preliminary methodology
Develop a computational pipeline utilizing unsupervised and semi-supervised machine
learning techniques. The initial model architecture will be constructed using the K-means
clustering algorithm to partition scRNA-seq expression profiles based on centroid distances. A
set of established, cell-type-specific canonical markers will be integrated into the model to
guide the initial clustering and automated annotation of mesenchymal populations within the
high-dimensional data. Following the identification of stable clusters, the model will perform
differential expression analysis to derive novel, high-resolution gene markers specific to each
distinct cellular sub-population, moving beyond traditional ambiguous identifiers.
Expected outcomes
Proof the concept of utilizing predictive machine learning to accurately partition and identify
distinct cellular phenotypes within complex scRNA-seq datasets. The primary output will be a
practical bioinformatic tool designed to resolve cellular identity in cases of ambiguous or
overlapping expression profiles. This tool will facilitate the automated annotation of
mesenchymal lineages and provide a validated catalog of novel, cluster-specific markers .
These refined biomarkers will offer higher sensitivity and specificity than current standards,
enabling a deeper understanding of cell-type-specific responses in both healthy and fibrotic
liver conditions.
