# AI for Sciences - Winter School Practical Works

This repository contains the practical work materials for the [Joint Winter School on AI for Sciences](https://event.ntu.edu.sg/Joint-Winter-School-AI-for-Sciences).

## Organization

The practical sessions are organized as Jupyter notebooks that can be executed directly in Google Colab. A Gmail account is required to access Google Colab.

## Schedule

### Day 1 (2pm - 5pm) - Raphael Cousin
- tp1.ipynb dataset datascience
- **tp0.ipynb**: Optimization of machine learning problems (gradient descent, linear regression, neural network backpropagation, CPU vs GPU)


### Day 2 (2pm - 5pm) - MLP Extended
- **tp1.ipynb**: Tokenization - Exploring specialized tokenizers for different scientific domains (text, chemistry/SMILES, DNA, proteins, music)
- **tp2.ipynb**: Embeddings for Scientific Domains - Multi-domain embedding exploration (scientific text, molecules, proteins, DNA) + classification with MLP
- **tp3.ipynb**: Fine-tuning - Fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific scientific task

### Day 3 (2pm - 5pm) - Raphael Cousin
- **tp1.ipynb**: YOLO presentation and fine tuned (medical imagery or a scientifi field)
- **tp2.ipynb**: generative model gan
